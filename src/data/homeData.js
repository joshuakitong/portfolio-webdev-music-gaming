      I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in <strong>Information Technology</strong>, majoring in <strong>Software Development</strong>.<br /><br />

      I worked as a <strong>Front-End Web Developer</strong> with over 3 years of experience developing web-based systems for U.S. utility cooperatives 
       using <strong>ASP.NET (C#)</strong>, <strong>AngularJS</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>Kendo UI</strong>. I also trained 
       in <strong>Angular</strong> and gained some back-end experience with <strong>PL/SQL</strong>.<br /><br />

      I then shifted to pursuing my creative careers full-time and paused my developer career, and just recently decided to return to development and have been catching up 
       on newer technologies mainly <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong> through hands-on projects.

      My creative journey began during the early stages of the pandemic, when I rediscovered my passion for music. Around that time, my brother and his friends 
       launched a record label and collective called BOX84, and I’ve been involved in the full production process ever since.<br /><br />

      I’ve learned to <strong>make beats</strong>, <strong>write and arrange songs</strong>, <strong>mix and master tracks</strong>, <strong>edit videos and graphics</strong>
       , <strong>release music across various platforms</strong>, and <strong>manage artists and social media pages</strong>. I primarily use <strong>FL Studio</strong>
       , <strong>Adobe Premiere Pro</strong>, and <strong>Photoshop</strong>.<br /><br />

      Since then, I’ve produced over a hundred tracks, generating over a million total streams across various platforms.

      I’ve been a gamer for as long as I can remember. It’s something I’ve always loved and dreamt of turning into a career. It’s also where I first began developing 
       my <strong>problem-solving</strong> and <strong>critical thinking skills</strong>.<br /><br />

      When NFT gaming surged during the last altcoin season, I didn’t hesitate and pursued my creative careers full-time, became 
       a <strong>competitive Axie Infinity player</strong>, and a <strong>coach</strong> and <strong>manager</strong> to a few scholars.<br /><br />

      As the NFT hype faded, I transitioned into being a <strong>Twitch streamer</strong> and <strong>content creator</strong> as Kits2g. I built a following 
       of thousands, consistently streamed to hundreds per session, and regularly hosted community events, marathon streams, and giveaways.
